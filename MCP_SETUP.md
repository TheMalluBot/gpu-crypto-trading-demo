# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you configure MCP servers to enhance development productivity for the GPU Crypto Trading application. MCP servers provide specialized capabilities that integrate with Claude Code for improved development workflows.

## Quick Setup

### 1. High Priority MCP Servers (Recommended)

```bash
# Install core MCP servers for immediate productivity gains
npm install -g @playwright/test
npm install -g github-mcp-server  
npm install -g exa-mcp-server
```

### 2. Configure Claude MCP Settings

Add these servers to your Claude MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/test"],

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP Server Not Responding**:
```bash
# Check server status
claude mcp list

# Restart specific server
claude mcp restart playwright

# Check configuration
cat ~/.claude.json | grep -A5 "mcpServers"
```

**Authentication Errors**:
- Verify API keys are correctly set in environment variables
- Check token permissions (GitHub tokens need appropriate scopes)
- Ensure Pieces Desktop app is running

**Performance Issues**:
- Monitor system resources during MCP operations
- Adjust server timeouts if needed
- Consider running fewer servers simultaneously on resource-constrained systems

## Security Considerations

- Store API keys securely (use environment variables, not hardcoded values)
- Regularly rotate tokens and API keys
- Monitor MCP server logs for unusual activity
- Keep MCP servers updated to latest versions
