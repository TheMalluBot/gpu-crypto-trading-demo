# Quick Fix for Windows Build

## The Issue
Your build failed because of React version conflicts and missing Rollup dependencies. Here's the fastest fix:

## Solution (Run in PowerShell on Windows side)

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd X:\ai\Algo\gpu-crypto-trading-demo

# 2. Clean everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force src-tauri\target -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Fix package.json dependencies (already done)
# The package.json has been fixed with compatible React 18 versions

# 4. Install with legacy peer deps
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 5. Build frontend
npm run build

# 6. Build Tauri app
npx tauri build
```

## Alternative: Direct Cargo Build (If npm still fails)

```powershell
# If npm is still problematic, build Rust directly:
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

## Expected Output Files

After successful build:
```
src-tauri\target\release\crypto_trader.exe           # Main executable
src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi            # Windows installer  
src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*-setup.exe     # NSIS installer
```

## If Dependencies Still Fail

Create this batch file and run it:

```batch
@echo off
echo Fixing dependencies...
rmdir /s /q node_modules 2>nul
del package-lock.json 2>nul
npm cache clean --force
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force
npm run build
npx tauri build
echo Build complete!
pause
```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ React version downgraded from 19 to 18 (compatible with lucide-react)
2. ✅ Vite version set to compatible version
3. ✅ All dependencies aligned for React 18
4. ✅ Production fixes included in build
5. ✅ Windows-specific build configuration ready

The app includes all the production improvements:
- Real API implementations
- Enhanced security  
- Proper error handling
- GPU risk management
- Complete trading functionality
