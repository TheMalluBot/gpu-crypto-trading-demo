## 🎯 Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Primary Merge ✅
```bash
# Merge genspark_ai_developer as the main codebase
git checkout main
git merge genspark_ai_developer
```
**Rationale**: This branch contains the most comprehensive feature set and is the most actively developed.

### Phase 2: Cherry-Pick Performance Optimizations ✅
```bash
# Get performance improvements from devin branch
git cherry-pick 50c15c8  # Performance optimizations
git cherry-pick 232f9e3  # Trading bot safety fixes
```
**Files to focus on**:
- Performance improvements in Rust backend
- Memory management enhancements
- Collection pre-allocation optimizations

### Phase 3: Extract WebSocket Features ✅
```bash
# Get live WebSocket features from live-price branch
git cherry-pick 63555f2  # Live Binance WebSocket implementation
```
**Files to integrate**:
- WebSocket manager improvements
- Real-time price feed enhancements

### Phase 4: Skip Conflicting Features ❌
**Skip these branches**:
- `feat/gpu-dashboard-1755007113` - Inferior GPU implementation compared to genspark_ai_developer
- Duplicate GPU dashboard features

## 🔧 Expected Conflicts and Resolutions

### 1. **App.tsx Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Multiple branches modify App.tsx
- **Resolution**: Keep genspark_ai_developer version (most comprehensive routing)
- **Action**: Manual merge of navigation improvements

### 2. **GPU Implementation Conflicts** 
- **Issue**: Different GPU approaches in different branches
- **Resolution**: Keep native GPU from genspark_ai_developer (CUDA/DirectX12/Vulkan)
- **Action**: Ignore conflicting WebGL implementation

### 3. **Build System Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Different build configurations
- **Resolution**: Keep comprehensive build system from genspark_ai_developer
- **Action**: Merge any missing build optimizations

### 4. **Trading Bot Logic Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Different trading implementations
- **Resolution**: Merge safety fixes from performance branch into genspark implementation
- **Action**: Careful manual review of trading logic

## 📁 Files Requiring Manual Review

### High Priority:
1. `src/App.tsx` - Ensure all features are integrated
2. `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Merge command handlers
3. `src-tauri/src/trading_strategy.rs` - Integrate safety fixes
4. `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Ensure all routes work
5. `src/services/WebSocketManager.ts` - Integrate live price features

### Medium Priority:
1. `package.json` - Merge dependencies
2. `tauri.conf.json` - Ensure build config is optimal
3. Performance optimizations in Rust files
4. Test files integration

## 🚨 Potential Issues and Mitigation

### Issue 1: Dependency Conflicts
- **Problem**: Different package versions across branches
- **Solution**: Use latest versions, test thoroughly
- **Action**: Update package.json after merge

### Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Problem**: Interface mismatches between branches
- **Solution**: Update interfaces to be compatible
- **Action**: Fix TypeScript errors iteratively

### Issue 3: Build System Integration
