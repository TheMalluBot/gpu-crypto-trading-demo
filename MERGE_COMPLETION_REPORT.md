### 🗂️ **Branch Analysis Results**

#### **Branches Merged:**
- ✅ **genspark_ai_developer** - Primary feature branch (FULLY MERGED)
- ✅ **main** - Updated with all latest features

#### **Branches Analyzed but Skipped:**
- ❌ **devin/1755003162-performance-optimizations** - Performance improvements (CONFLICTS with newer code)
- ❌ **feat/gpu-dashboard-1755007113** - GPU dashboard (INFERIOR to current implementation)
- ❌ **feat/live-price-2025-08-12** - WebSocket features (ALREADY INCLUDED in merged code)

#### **Rationale for Skipping:**
1. **Performance optimizations branch**: Had conflicts with the newer, more comprehensive code in genspark_ai_developer
