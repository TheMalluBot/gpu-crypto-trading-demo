# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |

## Security Measures Implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è **High Priority Security Fixes**

#### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) - XSS Protection ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: CSP allowed `unsafe-inline` for scripts and styles
- **Fix**: Removed `unsafe-inline` directives and implemented CSS variables for dynamic styling
- **Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks through inline script/style injection
- **Files**: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src/styles/index.css`

#### 2. Path Traversal Prevention ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: File operations could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks
- **Fix**: Implemented `SecurePathValidator` with comprehensive path sanitization
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized file system access
- **Files**: `src-tauri/src/secure_path.rs`, `src-tauri/src/secure_storage.rs`

#### 3. Session Management & Timeout ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: No session timeout or credential expiration
- **Fix**: Implemented `SecureSessionManager` with 24-hour expiration and 30-minute inactivity timeout
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access through stale sessions
- **Files**: `src/utils/sessionManager.ts`, `src/utils/secureStorage.ts`

#### 4. NPM Dependency Vulnerabilities ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: esbuild vulnerability in development environment (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- **Status**: Development-only vulnerability, production builds unaffected
- **Mitigation**: Use production builds for deployment, restrict dev server access
- **Impact**: Low risk in production, moderate in development

### üîí **Security Features**

#### Authentication & Authorization
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data storage
- Secure session management with automatic expiration
- Device-specific key generation for local encryption
- Input validation and sanitization throughout the application

#### Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Restricted CSP policies preventing script injection
- API rate limiting and request validation
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time data

#### File System Security
- Path traversal protection with secure path validation
- Sandboxed file operations within allowed directories
- Input sanitization for file names and paths
- Secure temporary file handling

#### Data Protection
- Encrypted storage for API keys and credentials
- Memory-safe handling of sensitive data
- Automatic data cleanup on session expiration
- Secure random number generation for cryptographic operations

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: [security@yourcompany.com] (placeholder)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Potential impact assessment
- Steps to reproduce
- Suggested fixes (if known)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (P0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach potential
- **SLA**: Fix within 1 week

#### High (P1)

- Significant data exposure
- Authentication issues
- **SLA**: Fix within 2 weeks

#### Medium (P2)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- **SLA**: Fix within 4 weeks

#### Low (P3)
- Security misconfigurations
- Minor information disclosure
- **SLA**: Fix in next release cycle

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers
1. **Always use HTTPS** in production environments
2. **Regularly update dependencies** with `npm audit`
3. **Use production builds** for deployment
4. **Restrict development server access** to localhost only
5. **Enable all security features** in production configuration

### For End Users
1. **Keep the application updated** to latest version
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for API credentials
3. **Log out when finished** to prevent session hijacking
4. **Monitor account activity** for unauthorized access
5. **Report suspicious behavior** immediately

## Security Configuration

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [ ] CSP headers properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all connections
- [ ] Session timeouts configured (24 hours max)
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Error messages sanitized (no sensitive data exposure)
- [ ] Logging configured for security events
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited

### Development Environment Security
- [ ] Development server restricted to localhost
- [ ] Separate API keys for development/production
- [ ] Test data does not contain real credentials
- [ ] Security testing performed before deployment

## Known Security Limitations

### Development Environment
- esbuild vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) in development server
- **Mitigation**: Use only in trusted development environments

### Platform Considerations
- File system access restricted by Tauri security model
- WebView security depends on system WebView implementation
- Network requests subject to system firewall and proxy settings

## Security Updates

| Date | Version | Security Fix | Severity |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| 2025-01-26 | 0.1.0 | CSP hardening, Path traversal prevention, Session management | High |
